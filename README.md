# A User Friendly Approach to Short Duration Time Perception Experimentation
Included is a body of MATLAB code designed for running time perception experiments using [Psychtoolbox 3.0.19](http://psychtoolbox.org/download) on [MATLAB 2024B](https://www.mathworks.com/products/new_products/latest_features.html). Psychtoolbox is open access and free to use, while MATLAB can be accessed via a subscription by most universities and organizations. No packages or other dependencies are required except for those included here.

## What kinds of experiments can I run using this code?
This code only supports visual prospective time replication and comparison experiments. 

### Replication Experiments
Time replication experiments assess how well a user can replicate a given time interval, inidirectly assessing patients' working memory capacity as they temporarily store the interval duration before replicating it. The presented time intervals can be auditory or visual. Only visual intervals are supported here. 

The following customizations can be made to the base experiment:
- Replication Type: There are several common ways for a participant to replicate the subjective duration of a visual stimulus. They include pressing a key to start and pressing a key to end the replicated interval, holding on a key for the subjective duration of the interval, and receiving a signal that the replicated interval has begun and pressing a key to stop the interval.
- Durations: The number and length of intervals 
- Stimuli: A default stimulus of a large circle can be
